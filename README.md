# aws-api-gateway

The complete AWS API Gateway Framework, powered by [Serverless Components](https://github.com/serverless/components).

## Features

- Create & manage new API Gateway REST APIs with very simple configuration.
- Extend Existing API Gateway REST APIs without disrupting other services.
- Integrate with AWS Lambda via the [aws-lambda component](https://github.com/serverless-components/aws-lambda)
- Authorize requests with AWS Lambda authorizers
- Create proxy endpoints for any URL with 3 lines of code
- Create mock endpoints by specifying the object you'd like to return (coming soon)
- Debug API Gateway requests Via CloudWatch Logs (coming soon)
- Protect your API with API Keys (coming soon)
- Add usage plans to your APIs (coming soon)
- Configure throttling & rate limits (coming soon)
- Trace requests with AWS X-Ray (coming soon)

### 1. Install

```shell
$ npm install -g serverless
```

### 2. Create

Just create the following simple boilerplate:

```shell
$ touch serverless.yml # more info in the "Configure" section below
$ touch index.js       # your lambda code
$ touch .env           # your AWS api keys
```

```
# .env
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=XXX
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=XXX
```

the `index.js` file should look something like this:


```js

module.exports.createUser = async (e) => {
  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: 'Created User'
  }
}

module.exports.getUsers = async (e) => {
  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    body: 'Got Users'
  }
}

module.exports.auth = async (event, context) => {
  return {
    principalId: 'user',
    policyDocument: {
      Version: '2012-10-17',
      Statement: [
        {
          Action: 'execute-api:Invoke',
          Effect: 'Allow',
          Resource: event.methodArn
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}

```

Keep reading for info on how to set up the `serverless.yml` file.

### 3. Configure
You can configure the component to either create a new REST API from scratch, or extend an existing one.

#### Creating REST APIs
You can create new REST APIs by specifying the endpoints you'd like to create, and optionally passing a name 
and description for your new REST API. You may also choose between a lambda proxy, or http integration by 
using the function or URI field respectively.

```yml
# serverless.yml

createUser:
  component: "@serverless/aws-lambda"
  inputs:
    code: ./code
    handler: index.createUser
getUsers:
  component: "@serverless/aws-lambda"
  inputs:
    code: ./code
    handler: index.getUsers
auth:
  component: "@serverless/aws-lambda"
  inputs:
    code: ./code
    handler: index.auth

restApi:
  component: "@serverless/aws-api-gateway"
  inputs:
    description: Serverless REST API
    endpoints:
      - path: /users
        method: POST
        function: ${createUser.arn}
        authorizer: ${auth.arn}
      - path: /users
        method: GET
        function: ${getUsers.arn}
        authorizer: ${auth.arn}

        # create a resource with a variable in the path
      - path: /users/{ID}
        method: PUT
        # The above path makes ID available to use in your uri
        URI: https://example.com/users/{ID}
        # authorizer also take a name for existing endpoints
        authorizer: auth-dev
        # params sets method and integration request headers and querystring parameters
        params:
          headers:
            auth: true  # keys with a boolean value state whether it is required or not
            policy: users-mod
          querystrings:
            name: true
            status: active # keys with a string value creates a corresponding static variable in integration request only
```

#### Extending REST APIs
You can extend existing REST APIs by specifying the REST API ID. This will **only** create, remove & manage the specified endpoints without removing or disrupting other endpoints.

```yml
# serverless.yml

createUser:
  component: "@serverless/aws-lambda"
  inputs:
    code: ./code
    handler: index.createUser
getUsers:
  component: "@serverless/aws-lambda"
  inputs:
    code: ./code
    handler: index.getUsers

restApi:
  component: "@serverless/aws-api-gateway"
  inputs:
    id: qwertyuiop # specify the REST API ID you'd like to extend
    endpoints:
      - path: /users
        method: POST
        function: ${createUser.arn}
      - path: /users
        method: GET
        function: ${getUsers.arn}
```

### 4. Deploy

```shell
$ serverless
```
